<p>Mario Peña, a 43-year-old from the Dominican Republic, never expected to find himself walking along the NYC streets without a home. A job in construction brought him to the big city when he was 20 years old and
with him, many dreams that now seem too far away to reach.</p>

<p>Peña is a homosexual man who left his native country in 1998 to explore a life filled with acceptance and changes in New York City. "When I got here [NYC], I wanted to work, fall in love, and build a family. Now I only have this", he says, referring to a bag filled with clothes and jackets that help him keep warm in the cold weather that already is covering the east coast of The United States.</p>

<p>After ending his last relationship and losing his job in construction because of the Covid-19 pandemic,
Mario Peña finds himself without a home and resources.</p>
<p>Like him, there are many LGBTQ+ people who experience homelesness. Many also experience food insecurity.</p>


<p>Food insecurity is "not having food to eat or not knowing where your next meal is going to come from," as stated by the Department of Social Services from the state of New York.</p>

<p>Food Bank NYC is a non-profit organization that helps communities experiencing this issue in NYC. Their mission
is to provide food at no cost to people in need, but they have a program called "Fight on Feed All" directly targeted to members of the LGBTQ+ community.</p>
<p>Their primary location is at 116th Street in West Harlem, where Camesha Grant, vice-president, and communications
the director explained that they have always cared about giving a plate of food to people who don't have access to one.
"Members of the LGBTQ+ community have always been beneficiaries of our services, and we want to support them, no matter the reason why they visit us," said Grant.</p>

<p>Today, Food Bank NYC's services can be accessed through "Grubhub" a delivery app where people can request free food from the organization."</p>

<p>At the FBNYC's community kitchen, Peña, while having vegetables and roasted chicken, said, "I don't always come here, but
when I do, they treat me very well, don't judge me, don't ask questions, they just give me food. I don't know if I will eat tomorrow, but today I'm thankful for places like this."</p>

<p>New York City offers help to people experiencing food insecurity, whether they identify as part of the LGBTQ+ community or not.
The city is making a call to action to people who need help to apply for "SNAP" through the website or via phone to avoid in-person contact because of the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>

<p>TThe pandemic has also played a significant role in people suffering financial issues that result in homelessness and food insecurity.
The Williams Institute of the UCLA's School of Law says that 27% of the population that identifies as LGBTQ+ in the United States
(more than 13,042,000) reported experiencing no food or lack of access to food in the past year.</p>

<p>Almost 11% of people who identify as LGBTQ+ and participated in the Hulsey Pulse Survey from the Census Bureau
reported experiencing food insecurity, while only 2% was reported from people who identify as heterosexuals.</p>

<p>Jennifer Shaoul, executive director of Disability Affairs at the Department of Social Services in New York City, said "[that food insecurity] is a big issue in the city and doesn't get talked about as much as it should." Shaoul highlighted programs
that the city offers like "SNAP" to facilitate access to food." ... "There is no reason to be ashamed; we all need food," affirmed Shaoul on the
importance of asking for help.</p>

<p>Mario Peña, who has not yet applied for "SNAP" benefits or asked for help from the city s waiting to get out of the streets soon, find a job, and ask for help to
receive benefits that will allow him to have food every day.</p>
